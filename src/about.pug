                    span Hi, I am Nica!
                    p I am a web designer and developer from the Philippines. I also dabble in different art forms such as photography and graphic design. 
                    p When Iâ€™m not working, I can be seen galavanting around the city with my mountain bike or playing with my little hobbit pup named Samwise.

                    p I've been working with individual entrepreneurs and small businesses for the past six years. I provided them branding services from the ground up where I helped them with their brand identity which includes web design and development.
                    p I consider myself as an avid learner, whether it be brushing up on existing skills or learning new things, I am eager to learn it.
